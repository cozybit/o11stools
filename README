Some scripts to graph an o11s mesh.

requirements:
- nodes must be running avahi-daemon, and have a common hostname prefix
  HOST_BASE. ipv6 mcast ping is probably better.
- set SSH_KEY to point toward your private ssh key, and install the public key on
  the nodes. A passphraseless key is included for you convenience.

usage:
- try ./mesh_graph
